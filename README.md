#Weather App
This is a project in which user can search the weather of any city. The app pulls data from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/).

This is not made from deployment because the API key has to be protected and this app has no such functionality. However, the main purpose of building this app is to learn fetching data from API and rendering it on the frontend.
